// Builds the WASM artifacts from the pinned Rust sources and writes them as
// committed, importable JS modules (base64 + sha256 of the wasm bytes):
//   entropylab-wasm/ -> src/js/entropylab-wasm-b64.js
//   psbt-wasm/       -> src/js/psbt-wasm-b64.js
//   vanity-wasm/     -> src/js/vanity-wasm-b64.js
//
// The generated modules are committed so that `npm run build` keeps working
// with Node alone. CI rebuilds them from the Rust sources (pinned by each
// crate's rust-toolchain.toml and Cargo.lock) and runs the WASM test suites
// against the fresh build, so a stale committed copy cannot survive; the
// artifact job commits the runner's copy back after each merge. Builds are
// path-independent (see the remaps below), so the reproduce CI job proves
// byte identity across staging paths inside the dev image; across machines
// the bytes still depend on the builder's clang (the C side of
// secp256k1-sys), which is why the pinned dev image is the canonical build
// environment. Build-host paths are remapped below so the binaries do not
// carry the builder's home directory.

// /home/<user>/.cargo/...) into panicking code of registry sources, which
// both fingerprints the build host and breaks cross-machine comparisons.
// Honour CARGO_HOME/RUSTUP_HOME rather than assuming $HOME layouts — the
// dev image sets them to /usr/local/{cargo,rustup} — and map the checkout
// itself to a fixed virtual root so the bytes do not depend on where the
// repository sits. clang gets the same treatment for __FILE__ in the
// vendored C (secp256k1-sys) via the cc crate's target-specific CFLAGS.
